# timeseries-analysis
Code to run cpu intensive processes, collect the stats and to generate time series data from them.

- Run wrap1.py and direct the stdout to a file, say output.txt.
- Run digest.py on the file, here output.txt, to generate the time series data. One file per pass will be created.
